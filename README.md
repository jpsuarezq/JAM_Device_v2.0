# JAM_Device_v2.0
This is a class project in which we wanted to measure a maximum current of 50 A, a maximum voltage of 120 VRms, know the energy and transmit the data to a cell phone. The design was made with the ESP8266, ADE9153A, the Arduino IoT Cloud platform in its free version. 

For the creation of the 4-layer PCB, the page https://easyeda.com/es was used.

The code used for the project is shared. The libraries can be found at: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/arduino/tree/master/Arduino%20Uno%20R3/libraries/ADE9153A
